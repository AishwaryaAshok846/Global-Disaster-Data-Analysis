# Global Natural Disaster Analysis (1900-2021)

An exploratory data analysis of 16,126 natural disaster events examining global patterns, trends, and human/economic impact across different disaster types and regions.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [All Natural Disasters 1900-2021 by Baris Dincer (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/all-natural-disasters-19002021-eosdis)  
- **Time Period**: 1900–2021  
- **Records**: 16,126 disaster events  
- **Coverage**: Global (all continents)

## Key Questions

1. Which types of natural disasters occur most frequently?  
2. How has the frequency of disaster events changed over time?  
3. Which disaster types cause the highest human impact?  
4. Which disaster types result in the greatest economic damage?  
5. How does disaster frequency and impact vary across continents?

## Key Findings

- **Floods (34.4%)** and **storms (27.9%)** account for 62% of all recorded disasters  
- Recorded disaster events increased significantly since the 1970s  
- Droughts and epidemics cause the highest death tolls  
- Storms and floods result in the greatest economic damage  
- Asia experiences the highest disaster frequency and human impact

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib`  
3. Open `global_disaster_data_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab  
4. Run all cells sequentially

## Limitations

- Dataset contains missing economic damage data for many events (~68%)  
- Earlier years may suffer from underreporting
- Analysis does not account for population size or regional preparedness differences
